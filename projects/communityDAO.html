                                            enDAOment is a platform for decentralized governance that enables communities to self-organize around 
                                            shared goals or values, easily and efficiently. It is meant to be a dApp (decentralized application) 
                                            that is a universal portal to participate in DAO voting.

                                            “UX Ideation Challenge: Blockchain and Web3 Powered Future CX.”</a> A common theme in Web3 projects so 
                                            far has been a lack of consideration for human needs and the UX, so the goal of this project was to 
                                            identify and design a potential user experience that blockchain technology could revolutionize.

                                            prototype as the final outcome.

                                            Barometer, an annual study of institutions around the world. It found that only 52 percent of 
                                            Americans have faith that nonprofits will “do what is right.” A recent survey by the Better 
                                            Business Bureau brought more bad news: <u>Seventy percent said trust is “essential” before making 
                                            a donation</u>, but fewer than 20 percent of Americans said they highly trust charities.

                                            I reached out on social media to friends, asking for participants in an interview regarding 
                                            their experiences with buying insurance. I gathered 5 participants, all between the ages of 
                                            20 and 55, who I interviewed via Zoom and in person. Some noticeable patterns from these 
                                            interviews were:

                                        <h3>OK, so WTF is a DAO?</h3>
                                        <hr>
                                        <p>
                                            A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an entity with no central leadership. <u>Decisions 
                                            get made from the bottom-up, governed by a community organized around a specific set of rules 
                                            enforced on a blockchain.</u>
                                            <br><br>
                                            Being internet-native organizations, DAOs have several advantages over traditional organizations. 
                                            One significant advantage of DAOs is the lack of trust needed between two parties. While a traditional 
                                            organization requires a lot of trust in the people behind it — especially on behalf of investors — <u>with 
                                            DAOs, only the code needs to be trusted.</u>
                                            <br><br>
                                            Trusting that code is easier to do as it’s publicly available and can be extensively tested before 
                                            launch. <u>Every action a DAO takes after being launched must be approved by the community and is 
                                            completely transparent and verifiable.</u>

                                            Based on the user research I set up two personas. I referred to them throughout the 
                                            entire product development process. Each persona had a scenario that identified a realistic 
                                            goal the user might have when working with this dApp. The information about each persona 
                                            focused on its goals and frustrations with interacting with charitable organizations, 
                                            which drastically affected my design decisions.

                                            Creating mid-fidelity wireframes helps me focus on the visual consistency and hierarchy

                                            After a few more iterations, I designed the final screens with Figma. My aim was a clean, 
                                            modern look that helps users complete their tasks without difficulty.

                                            A clickable prototype was created to test my ideas and validate the redesign. It was extremely 
                                            helpful for me to test users on the tasks that I focused on to gain realistic insights, also 
                                            understand what worked well and what requires further improvement. The prototype only covers

                                            for me. While blockchain technology is relatively new, the concepts are pretty simple.

                                                ended. It takes the proposal as an argument and retrieves that proposal from the mapping. We 
                                                check whether the charity has already been paid or if the number of supporting votes is less 
                                                than those against. If either of these conditions are true then the transaction will be reverted 
                                                with an error message. If not, the paid property of the proposal is set true, the address of the

                                            had some difficulty with the third task because they were looking for a settings icon, but 
                                            once I referred to it as the “user preferences” page, they knew how to find it easier.

                                            to develop my skills introducing blockchain technologies to the general population. Here

                                            Web3 is daunting concept for most users, but it is essentially a new way to accomplish the 
                                            same tasks. My goal was to only use “techy” jargon only when absolutely necessary to make 
                                            the transition from using web2 applications to web3 dApps as seamless as possible.

                                            According to Jakob’s Law, users spend most of their time on other sites and would prefer 
                                            to use products that work the same way as the sites they already know. Thus, I 
                                            designed enDAOment to look and feel like a basic voting app, even though its completely

                                            Overall, web3 is (<i>most likely</i>) the future, but the high barrier of entry (extensive 
                                            knowledge about blockchain lingo is practically required) is slowing down its inevitable 
                                            takeover of the internet. But, I believe that slowly (and painlessly) integrating blockchain 
                                            technologies into the general population’s everyday lives is path forward. While decentralized 
                                            autonomous organizations (DAOs) initially seem convoluted and complicated, I feel like enDAOment 
                                            is a great first step into the world of smart contracts.
