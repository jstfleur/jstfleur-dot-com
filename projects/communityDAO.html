                                            “UX Ideation Challenge: Blockchain and Web3 Powered Future CX.”</a> A common theme in Web3 projects so 
                                            far has been a lack of consideration for human needs and the UX, so the goal of this project was to 
                                            identify and design a potential user experience that blockchain technology could revolutionize.

                                            Nonprofits face some serious trust issues: About a third of Americans don’t trust charitable groups 
                                            to spend their funds well, and more than 60% of people globally don’t have faith that groups can 
                                            accomplish their missions. But <u>groups that perform well may be able to raise more money simply by 
                                            becoming more transparent</u>: People like having the opportunity to vet places themselves before making 
                                            a contribution.

                                            As trust in nonprofits sinks to new lows, charitable organizations could face many threats to their 
                                            ability to carry out their missions, including trouble raising cash, attracting top talent, and 
                                            persuading Americans to take action on social, environmental, and other key issues.
                                            <br><br>
                                            Only slightly more than half of Americans trust nonprofits, according to the 2019 Edelman Trust 
                                            Barometer, an annual study of institutions around the world. It found that only 52 percent of 
                                            Americans have faith that nonprofits will “do what is right.” A recent survey by the Better 
                                            Business Bureau brought more bad news: <u>Seventy percent said trust is “essential” before making 
                                            a donation</u>, but fewer than 20 percent of Americans said they highly trust charities.

                                        <hr>
                                        <p>
                                            I reached out on social media to friends, asking for participants in an interview regarding 
                                            their experiences with buying insurance. I gathered 5 participants, all between the ages of 
                                            20 and 55, who I interviewed via Zoom and in person. Some noticeable patterns from these 
                                            interviews were: 
                                            <br> <br>
                                            <strong>Results:</strong>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Most users have been <b>somewhat skeptical</b> about where charitable donations end up.</li>
                                                <li><b>60%</b> of those interviewed thought that they should have an opinion in how their donations were spent in some organizations.</li>
                                                <li>Every single user interviewed would appreciate transparency in how donations were spent.</li>
                                                <li><b>60%</b> of users were familiar with the concept of a DAO.</li>

                                        <h3>OK, so WTF is a DAO?</h3>
                                        <hr>
                                        <p>
                                            A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an entity with no central leadership. <u>Decisions 
                                            get made from the bottom-up, governed by a community organized around a specific set of rules 
                                            enforced on a blockchain.</u>
                                            <br><br>
                                            Being internet-native organizations, DAOs have several advantages over traditional organizations. 
                                            One significant advantage of DAOs is the lack of trust needed between two parties. While a traditional 
                                            organization requires a lot of trust in the people behind it — especially on behalf of investors — <u>with 
                                            DAOs, only the code needs to be trusted.</u>
                                            <br><br>
                                            Trusting that code is easier to do as it’s publicly available and can be extensively tested before 
                                            launch. <u>Every action a DAO takes after being launched must be approved by the community and is 
                                            completely transparent and verifiable.</u>

                                            Based on the user research I set up two personas. I referred to them throughout the 
                                            entire product development process. Each persona had a scenario that identified a realistic 
                                            goal the user might have when working with this app. The information about each persona 
                                            focused on its goals and frustrations with interacting with charitable organizations, 
                                            which drastically affected my design decisions.

                                            I turned my revised sketches into a black and white interactive prototype in Figma. 
                                            Creating mid-fidelity wireframes helps me focus on the visual consistency and hierarchy 
                                            before applying styles. I tested the prototype in-person and remotely.

                                                My two oldest participants didn’t recognize the that the term “pieces,” implied “fashion pieces.” 
                                                This was important because I realized that I was designing for mainly a younger, college aged

                                            After a few more iterations, I designed the final screens with Figma. My aim was a clean, 
                                            modern look that helps users fulfill their goals quickly. "silhouette" is a fun fashion app; 
                                            therefore, I focused on the colors scheme to help transmit a friendly, yet elegant, vibe.

                                                    So, I designed the navigation to be at the bottom of the screen so it will be easier

                                                    opposite upper corners to ensure that the target button will be clicked correctly.

                                            using the prototype using the <u>minimum number of clicks</u>:

                                        <p>
                                            Ultimately, all users managed to successfully complete four out of the five tasks. One user 
                                            had some difficulty with the fourth task, as the instructions were, admittedly, not very 
                                            clear; but they ultimately completed the task with a couple extra taps.

                                            Everyone involved in my first round of testing was an engineering student between the ages 
                                            of 19 and 24, which was a huge red flag, because I was getting similar responses from everyone. 
                                            When I invited younger and older users to test the product during the second round of testing, 
                                            I saw the product through a different lens and had to come up with solutions that would help 
                                            <i>their</i> problems.

                                            This was my first case study and it was pretty obvious in hindsight that I was designing 
                                            I product that I wanted and not what the user wanted. I should have used personas that 
                                            didn't reflect my friends and I, but instead reflected a wider audience.

                                            I allocated two weeks of my time to accomplish the simple goal of “designing a product that 
                                            will get on-screen fashion into user’s closets.” I quickly realized that after all the user 
                                            research and testing, I simply didn’t have the time to design and test all the other extra features 
                                            I was thinking of implementing. Under the time constraints I put on myself, I used the design 
                                            process to accomplish that specific goal and recorded my results.

                                        <hr>
                                        <p>
                                            The main thing that I learned from this project is that I need to design for the entire 
                                            audience, not for people who think like me. I made assumptions, which ended up confusing 
                                            some users and lead to them tapping around aimlessly trying to complete tasks. At the end 
                                            of the day, user testing and the feedback I gained from it was crucial to making a seamless, 
                                            straightforward shopping experience for the users.
                                            <br><br>
                                            If I had more time for this project, the next step I would take is to design more features 
                                            for the app like I alluded to in the personas. I decided to cut the extra fluff because I 
                                            felt it was ultimately unnecessary for the case study. The whole point of this project was 
                                            to effectively utilize the double diamond design process while creating a product and to 
                                            document the experience, not to push a money-making app into the world.
                                            <br><br>
                                            Overall, for the time I put aside to complete this project, I think it was a success. I used 
                                            the design process to conceptualize an aesthetically pleasing product, that puts its users 
                                            first and I tried made things as simple as possible for users to buy things to maximize both 
                                            business goals and user experience.
