                            enDAOment is a platform for decentralized governance that enables communities to self-organize around shared goals or values, easily and efficiently. It is meant to be a dApp (decentralized application) that is a universal portal to participate in DAO voting.

                        <p>
                            Nonprofits face some serious trust issues: About a third of Americans don‚Äôt trust charitable groups to spend their funds well, and more than 60% of people globally don‚Äôt have faith that groups can accomplish their missions. But <u>groups that perform well may be able to raise more money simply by becoming more transparent</u>: People like having the opportunity to vet places themselves before making a contribution.

                            As trust in nonprofits sinks to new lows, charitable organizations could face many threats to their ability to carry out their missions, including trouble raising cash, attracting top talent, and persuading Americans to take action on social, environmental, and other key issues.
                            <br><br>
                            Only slightly more than half of Americans trust nonprofits, according to the 2019 Edelman Trust Barometer, an annual study of institutions around the world. It found that only 52 percent of Americans have faith that nonprofits will ‚Äúdo what is right.‚Äù A recent survey by the Better Business Bureau brought more bad news: <u>Seventy percent said trust is ‚Äúessential‚Äù before making a donation</u>, but fewer than 20 percent of Americans said they highly trust charities.

                        <p>
                            A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an entity with no central leadership. <u>Decisions get made from the bottom-up, governed by a community organized around a specific set of rules enforced on a blockchain.</u>
                            <br><br>
                            Being internet-native organizations, DAOs have several advantages over traditional organizations. One significant advantage of DAOs is the lack of trust needed between two parties. While a traditional organization requires a lot of trust in the people behind it ‚Äî especially on behalf of investors ‚Äî <u>with DAOs, only the code needs to be trusted.</u>
                            <br><br>
                            Trusting that code is easier to do as it‚Äôs publicly available and can be extensively tested before launch. <u>Every action a DAO takes after being launched must be approved by the community and is completely transparent and verifiable.</u>

                            I drew the sketches on blank index cards to build an interactive paper prototype and tested some user stories with five different individuals. Using paper prototypes enabled me to examine my ideas before putting everything in the daunting process of digitizing.
                            <br><br>
                            After some preliminary testing, the criticism I collected was very positive. I asked users to talk out loud and explain every decision they made as they navigated the prototype. From this feedback, I knew I was on the right track. One notable change that I made was replacing the term ‚Äúpolls‚Äù with ‚Äúproposals‚Äù to be more accurate.

                            I turned my revised sketches into a black and white interactive prototype in Figma. Creating mid-fidelity wireframes helps me focus on the visual consistency and hierarchy before applying styles. I tested the prototype in-person and remotely.

                            From my second round of testing, I found out that users were able to navigate through the dApp successfully, which was very promising.

                            After a few more iterations, I designed the final screens with Figma. My aim was a clean, modern look that helps users complete their tasks without difficulty.

                            A clickable prototype was created to test my ideas and validate the redesign. It was extremely helpful for me to test users on the tasks that I focused on to gain realistic insights, also understand what worked well and what requires further improvement. The prototype only covers the aspects of tasks that I planned to test users on.

                        <hr>
                        <p>
                            I have a background in computer engineering, so deciphering smart contracts wasn‚Äôt too difficult for me. While blockchain technology is relatively new, the concepts are pretty simple.

                            A couple of Solidity functions that would be used if the project were to go beyond being just a case study:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="list-style: none;">

                                Users of the DAO will be of two types - Contributors and Stakeholders. We need to declare two constants here, which are the keccak256 hash of the words themselves. These constants will be used later to register and differentiate users. 
                            </li>

                                <br>
                                There are four mappings used:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        charityProposals maps a uint256 value and a CharityProposal as key and value respectively. This holds the list of Proposals in the DAO. It uses the id of the Proposal as key and the Proposal itself as the value.
                                    </li>
    
                                    <li>
                                        stakeholderVotes maps the address of a Stakeholder to a list of the Proposals that address has voted on.
                                    </li>
    
                                    <li>
                                        contributors maps the Contributor addresses and the amounts they have sent into the DAO treasury.
                                    </li>
    
                                    <li>
                                        stakeholders maps the addresses and balances of Stakeholders.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
    
                            </li>

                                <br>
                                The vote() function is an external function that allows voting on proposals when called with the proposal‚Äôs id and a second true/false argument depending on whether the vote is in support or against the proposal.
                            </li>

                                <br>
                                payCharity handles payment to the specified address after the voting period of the proposal has ended. It takes the proposal as an argument and retrieves that proposal from the mapping. We check whether the charity has already been paid or if the number of supporting votes is less than those against. If either of these conditions are true then the transaction will be reverted with an error message. If not, the paid property of the proposal is set true, the address of the stakeholder making the payment is set, and finally emit the PaymentTransfered event for logging purposes and transfer the payment to the charity address.

                        <hr>
                        <p>
                            To validate my proposed solutions, I asked five users to perform the following set of tasks using the prototype using the <u>minimum number of clicks</u>:
                        </p>
    
                        <ol>
                            <li>Find the number of unique participants in the first proposal. <b>(5/5 completed successfully)</b></li>
                            <li>Vote yes on a proposal. <b>(5/5 completed successfully)</b></li>
                            <li>Find the preferences page. <b>(4/5 completed successfully)</b></li>
                            <li>Check the comments on a proposal. <b>(5/5 completed successfully)</b></li>
                            <li>Tell me how many DAO proposals the user has participated in. <b>(5/5 completed successfully)</b></li>
                        </ol>
    
                        <p>
                            In the end, all users managed to successfully complete four out of the five tasks. One user had some difficulty with the third task because they were looking for a settings icon, but once I referred to it as the ‚Äúuser preferences‚Äù page, they knew how to find it easier.

                        <p>
                            This project was a great experience for me to not only improve my design skills, but also to develop my skills introducing blockchain technologies to the general population. 
                            <br>
                            Here were some of my takeaways:
                            <br><br>
    
                            <b>Keep it simple, stupid</b>
                            <br>
                            Web3 is daunting concept for most users, but it is, essentially, a new way to accomplish the same tasks. My goal was to only use ‚Äútechy‚Äù jargon only when absolutely necessary to make the transition from using web2 applications to web3 dApps as seamless as possible.
                            <br><br>
    
                            <b>Jakob‚Äôs Law</b>
                            <br>
                            According to Jakob‚Äôs Law, users spend most of their time on other sites and would prefer to use products that work the same way as the sites they already know. Thus, I designed enDAOment to look and feel like a basic voting app, even though its completely blockchain-based.

                        <p>
                            Overall, web3 is (most likely) the future, but the high barriers of entry (extensive knowledge about blockchain lingo is practically required) is slowing down its inevitable takeover of the internet. But, I believe that slowly (and painlessly) integrating blockchain technologies into the general population‚Äôs everyday lives is path forward. While decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) initially seem convoluted and complicated, I feel like enDAOment is a great first step into the world of smart contracts.
