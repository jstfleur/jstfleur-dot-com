                        <hr>
                        <p>myGNV was our final project for the UX design course at the University of Florida. We were given a brief from the city of Gainesvilleâ€™s Office of Strategic Initiatives and were challenged to complete the project in 6 weeks or 3 agile sprints. The cityâ€™s representative wanted us to create a local resource finder that gave the user information about resources that they were qualified for. </p>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>My group (3 other students and I) was given this task during the COVID-19 pandemic which made it even more difficult because we were only able to communicate through Zoom and Slack.</p>
                        <br><br>

                        <p>Our team used Agile methodology in the development of myGNV to reduce the amount of research and documentation to a minimum, form quick assumptions and hypotheses instead, and move forward faster.</p>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>Agile is all about cutting down on the number of steps in the design process, creating quick solutions, measuring and validating them, getting feedback (e.g., through A/B or usability testing), seeing what works, and then applying the best options. This way, the design can be delivered as fast as possible.</p>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>The duration of the project was split into three sprints, each two weeks long.</p>

                            <strong>User interviews are critical!</strong>
                            <br>
                            Our team conducted user interviews over Zoom and were surprised by the results we collected. As four college students, we were blinded by our privilege and didnâ€™t take many things into account, including literacy levels, visual impairments, and access to internet. 
                        </p>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Designing as a team requires frequent communication!</strong>
                            <br>
                            We were given this task in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, which meant that we were only able to communicate with each other over Zoom and Slack. To stay on top of our workload during sprints, we quickly realized that we need to have team meetings a couple times a week and complete our parts of the projects early so they could be passed off to the next.

                        <hr>
                        <p>While the project didnâ€™t end up getting picked up for development, it was still a lot of fun working as a team on this project. If we were to continue working on the project, I would like to create a full clickable prototype. I would, also, love to see the project come to life and see itâ€™s impact on the community but heyâ€¦ you win some and you lose some.</p>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>Overall, this was my first time working with a shareholder on a UX assignment and I enjoyed the experience! Also, it was very eye opening talking to members of the community and realizing how inaccessible most products are for them and learning what our team could do to remedy that.</p>
