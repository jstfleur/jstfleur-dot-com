                                            silhouette is a community based mobile app that identifies iconic fashion pieces from movies, 
                                            TV shows, and social media posts.

                                            In this project, I took on the fashion industry, which is projected to rack up to $3.3 trillion 
                                            by 2030. I decided to design a user-friendly and aesthetic app which would streamline the process 
                                            of getting users‚Äô on-screen style inspirations into their closets. As the sole designer on this 
                                            project, I executed the design process end-to-end, with a high-fidelity prototype as the final 
                                            outcome.

                                            As a terminally online twenty-something, I spend a lot of time mindlessly scrolling through 
                                            Twitter. One day, I went through my favorite reality TV show‚Äôs hashtag and noticed a flood of posts 
                                            asking where they could get a contestant‚Äôs signature black and white hoodie. These posts 
                                            gained dozens, if not hundreds, of likes and retweets as the fans scoured the internet 
                                            looking that SPECIFIC hoodie. And when that hoodie was finally found, it was completely 
                                            sold out before the end of the week.

                                            face, right on my phone screen. <b>There was a HUGE demand for clothing worn in TV shows and movies,

                                            TV drama series have transported millions of viewers to worlds beyond reach

                                            causing a surge in search for varsity jackets (<strong>+53%</strong>), plaid vests

                                            I conducted a user survey to gain insight on users' shopping habits. To reach a larger audience, I wrote a 
                                            short, 10-question survey and posted it in different Slack and Discord groups, all within 
                                            the University of Florida, to get a general idea of how they shopped for new clothes. I 
                                            received 15 responses.
                                            <br> <br>
                                            From there, I reached out to a few individuals from the surveys for a more in-depth analysis. 
                                            With each person we had a conversation on how they view‚Ä¶ Some noticeable patterns from these

                                                <li><strong>86%</strong> said they would rather buy new clothing online than in person. <strong>Solution: I need to create a mobile app.</strong></li>
                                                <li>Most users would rather buy online, rather than in person, due to convenience and greater availability. <strong>Solution: The app needs to make it easy to find pieces and streamline the buying process.</strong></li>
                                                <li><strong>80%</strong> claimed that popular culture (TV shows, movies, social media, etc.) was a source of style inspiration. <strong>Solution: The app should focus on staying up to date with trending shows and movies.</strong></li>
                                                <li>Every single user interviewed has been interested in buying at least one article of clothing that they saw in a movie or TV show. <strong>Solution: Users should be able to find specific pieces easily.</strong></li>

                                            Based on the user research I set up two personas. I referred to them throughout the 
                                            entire product development process. Each persona had a scenario that identified a realistic 
                                            goal the user might have when working with this app. The information about each persona 
                                            focused on its goals and frustrations with their current process of buying new clothes, 
                                            which drastically affected my design decisions.

                                            I turned my revised sketches into a black and white interactive prototype in Figma. 
                                            Creating mid-fidelity wireframes helps me focus on the visual consistency and hierarchy 
                                            before applying styles. I tested the prototype in-person and remotely.

                                            modern look that helps users fulfill their goals quickly. "silhouette" is a fun fashion app; 
                                            therefore, I focused on the colors scheme to help transmit a friendly, yet elegant, vibe.

                                        <p>
                                            To validate my proposed solutions, I asked five users to perform the following set of tasks 
                                            using the prototype using the <u>minimum number of clicks</u>:

                                            Ultimately, all users managed to successfully complete four out of the five tasks. One user 
                                            had some difficulty with the fourth task, as the instructions were, admittedly, not very 
                                            clear; but they ultimately completed the task with a couple extra taps.

                                            Everyone involved in my first round of testing was an engineering student between the ages 
                                            of 19 and 24, which was a huge red flag, because I was getting similar responses from everyone. 
                                            When I invited younger and older users to test the product during the second round of testing, 
                                            I saw the product through a different lens and had to come up with solutions that would help 
                                            <i>their</i> problems.

                                            <br>
                                            This was my first case study and it was pretty obvious in hindsight that I was designing 
                                            I product that I wanted and not what the user wanted. I should have used personas that 
                                            didn't reflect my friends and I, but instead reflected a wider audience.

                                            I allocated two weeks of my time to accomplish the simple goal of ‚Äúdesigning a product that 
                                            will get on-screen fashion into user‚Äôs closets.‚Äù I quickly realized that after all the user 
                                            research and testing, I simply didn‚Äôt have the time to design and test all the other extra features 
                                            I was thinking of implementing. Under the time constraints I put on myself, I used the design 
                                            process to accomplish that specific goal and recorded my results.

                                        <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                                        <hr>
                                        <p>
                                            The main thing that I learned from this project is that I need to design for the entire 
                                            audience, not for people who think like me. I made assumptions, which ended up confusing 
                                            some users and lead to them tapping around aimlessly trying to complete tasks. At the end 
                                            of the day, user testing and the feedback I gained from it was crucial to making a seamless, 
                                            straightforward shopping experience for the users.
                                            <br><br>
                                            If I had more time for this project, the next step I would take is to design more features 
                                            for the app like I alluded to in the personas. I decided to cut the extra fluff because I 
                                            felt it was ultimately unnecessary for the case study. The whole point of this project was 
                                            to effectively utilize the double diamond design process while creating a product and to 
                                            document the experience, not to push a money-making app into the world.
                                            <br><br>
                                            Overall, for the time I put aside to complete this project, I think it was a success. I used 
                                            the design process to conceptualize an aesthetically pleasing product, that puts its users 
                                            first and I tried made things as simple as possible for users to buy things to maximize both 
                                            business goals and user experience.
